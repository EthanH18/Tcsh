42sh project for 42 school. Last project of the UNIX branch, the goal is to create a fully functionnal shell.

The goal was to start from 21sh (previous project) and make it evolve into a fully functional shell. The latest features to be added are diverse and potentially range from job control to shell scripting. This project will allow us to cover a wide range of standard UNIX and POSIX features.
